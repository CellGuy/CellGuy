I’m @CellGuy
I’m interested in the manufacturing of advanced cell-based products.
I’m currently working on a project to provide guidance for cell product developers on cellular starting materials, 
    ancillary materials, exipients and packaging materials.
 I’m looking learn about building a website or wiki to share the guidance.
You can reach me  at igviljoen@gmail.com
